ROBUSTNESS
 - smarter initial neuron placement (near stimuli)
 - repel loser neurons
	- delete consistent-loser neurons?
 - edit distance for sequences
 - annealing in sequence learn()
 - metric for evaluating clusters (distance-medians from Kohonen?); could throw out & start over when clusters seem subpar

INTERFACE
 - make train_single() pay attention to neighborhood

TEST CASES
 - Impro-Visor data

POSSIBLE PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
 - quantize could be batched and/or computed during training
 - quantize/cluster could return distances so user doesn't need to recalculate
   them if needed
 - don't do a full sort in train_single()
 - cluster() return array currently can have "gaps" for empty clusters; find a
   way to efficiently eliminate these?
