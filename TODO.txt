ROBUSTNESS
 - find ways around neuron-sharing (two clusters compete for one neuron)
	- smarter initial positioning?
 - better sequence distance metric (diff?)
 - annealing in sequence learn()

INTERFACE
 - make train_single() pay attention to neighborhood

POSSIBLE PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
 - quantize could be batched and/or computed during training
 - quantize/cluster could return distances so user doesn't need to recalculate
   them if needed
 - don't do a full sort in train_single()
 - cluster() return array currently can have "gaps" for empty clusters; find a
   way to efficiently eliminate these?
